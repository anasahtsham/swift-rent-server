# **Swift Rent Server v2.0.0**

## RESTful APIs

Successfully implemented the APIs for registering properties, hiring managers, creating tenant leases, rating users, filing complaints, keeping maintenance records, and viewing analytics. On top of this for the admin panel which helps us keep record of the number of users, the types and number of properties registered on platform, and a comprehensive customer support center for managing customer complaints.

## Responsive Landing Page

Using the root endpoint of my express server, hosted a bootstrap built responsive landing page, which showcases brief description of our product.
