## RESTful APIs

Successfully implemented the APIs for registering properties, hiring managers, creating tenant leases, rating users, filing complaints, keeping maintenance records, and viewing analytics. On top of this, the admin panel helps us keep records of the number of users, the types and number of properties registered on the platform, and provides a comprehensive customer support center for managing customer complaints.

Total API count: 88

## Automation

Used CRON JOBs from NODE-CRON library to automate lease and rent notices, adding of fines, creation of monthly records, and managing ON/OFF rent days.

## Responsive Landing Page

Using the root endpoint of my express server, we host a Bootstrap-built responsive landing page that showcases a brief description of our product.
